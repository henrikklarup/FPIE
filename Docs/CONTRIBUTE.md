# Contribution guidelines

- All new code should go on feature branches with PRs targeting `master`
- One approving review is required for merge
- Large changes/decisions are expected to be discussed and reviewed by multiple reviewers
- Favor small, single-purpose PRs over larger, long-lived branches
- Minute changes, such as fixing spelling corrections in comments, can go directly onto `master`
